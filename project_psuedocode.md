Great! Let's proceed with the first pass, focusing on generating pseudocode for the classes and interfaces we discussed. The pseudocode will outline the structure and key functionalities of each component. 

### Pseudocode for `CommitMessage` Class
```plaintext
Class CommitMessage:
    Method __str__():
        # Returns a string representation of the commit message.
```

### Pseudocode for `CommitMessageBuilder` Interface
```plaintext
Interface CommitMessageBuilder:
    Method __init__():
        # Constructor for the builder interface.
    
    Abstract Method build():
        # Abstract method to build and return a CommitMessage object.
```

### Pseudocode for `AcnCommitMessageBuilder` Class
```plaintext
Class AcnCommitMessageBuilder (implements CommitMessageBuilder):
    Method __init__():
        # Constructor initializing attributes for summary, description, etc.

    Method withSummary(summary: string):
        # Sets the summary part of the commit message.

    Method withDescription(description: string):
        # Sets the description part of the commit message.

    Method withAuthor(author: string):
        # Sets the author of the commit message.

    Method withCoAuthors(co_authors: string or list of strings):
        # Sets the co-authors of the commit message.
        # Handles both single string and list of strings inputs.

    Method withAuthorAlsoAsCoAuthor():
        # Includes the author as a co-author.

    Method withRisk(risk: string):
        # Sets the risk level of the commit message.

    Method withIntent(intent: string):
        # Sets the intent of the commit message.

    Private Method _loadRiskCodes():
        # Loads risk codes (internal use).

    Private Method _loadIntentCodes():
        # Loads intent codes (internal use).

    Method build():
        # Constructs and returns the final commit message.
        # Handles formatting based on specified template.
```

### Directory Structure
```plaintext
CommitMessageSystem/
│
├── __init__.py
│
├── commit_message.py
│   └── Class CommitMessage
│
├── commit_message_builder.py
│   └── Interface CommitMessageBuilder
│
└── acn_commit_message_builder.py
    └── Class AcnCommitMessageBuilder
```

This pseudocode provides an overview of the structure and key functionalities for each class and interface, as well as the directory structure for the project. The next step, after your review and any necessary adjustments, will be to generate the actual Python code.
