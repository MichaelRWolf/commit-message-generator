# Gregor observation -
We are sending code diff to ChatGPT.
And also sending instructions - saying that we want it to recognize refactorings.
And to answer in specific format -- JSON
Doing all of this in Python.
Using ApprovalTests to make sure it is (?) reproducible.

# Nitsan
The return value is reproducable.  Because the prompt format was specified

# Gregor
- We can use _ghis_(?) to evaluate how often it gives correct answer.

# Joel
- It looks like this is built to recognize refactorings.
- ? Is this part of the bigger goal.
- ? Why did we ask it for one type of code change (refactorings only) instead of other types
- It seems like this cannot work because the LLM models are not reproducible.
- ? How to you handle unreproducable output versus needs for testing.
- ? Inherent in creative output (e.g. Dall-e) ... there is no right answer.
- AI is not deterministic.

# Michael
- We are at human-in-the-loop.

# Nitsan
- Ideas
 - Extend JSON to create refactoring -- Recommend format.  Suggest ACN.
 - Use LLM as testing mechanism by having it review (in a separate prompt) and rate it 1-7.
    - Maybe that (review) could make the (original?) message fail.
    - This (may) get human out of the loop.

# Michael
?????
- Interesting that we ask for refactoring.  And ask for commit message.
- As programmers, we knee-jerk try to subdivide the problem.
- Maybe the right way to use AI is different from how we've been taught to think like programmers.
- Have multiple messages per commit.
- We are asking it do one thing.
- We could do this 'commit message' retroactively, thus using it to explore the past, not just the current slice.

# Proposals...
- Let's get coding.
- What's the goal?
  Lean-coffee style????
  - High level goal -
      - Use AI tool to generate commit messages.
      - Work together.  Experience working together.  Learning.
  - Medium goal - recognize refacgoring (holding off other recognitions until later)
  - Small goal - Bridge gap between refactoring automation -> commit message generation
  - <size> goal - Continue in same code base.




What?  So what?  Now what?
