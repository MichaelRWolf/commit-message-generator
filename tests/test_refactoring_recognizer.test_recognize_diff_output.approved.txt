Refactoring Identified: Rename Method

Details:
- Original method name: `some_function`
- New method name: `some_renamed_function`

This is a classic example of the Rename Method refactoring, where the name of a method is changed to better convey its purpose or to adhere to naming conventions. The body of the function remains unchanged (indicated by the unchanged `pass` statement), confirming that the only alteration is the renaming of the function itself.
