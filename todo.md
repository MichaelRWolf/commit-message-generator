# TODOs

-   [ ] add a .gitignore for .idea, `__pycache__`, etc.
-   [ ] move file to "proper" directories instead of under `/test`
-   [ ] make sure it works on everybody's envs with (e.g. we need a `OPENAI_API_KEY`) (Nitsan's key is saved in a variable that's accessible for all gitpod workspaces)
